# Welcome to the github download page for "Starlight"!
### My lightweight modpack for minecraft, now ported to github!

"Starlight" is my take on a lightweight and optimized modpack. This modpack was purely built from the ground up and is the bigger brother of a past modpack called: "Night Client".

"Starlight" is usable for other things than PVP or Surivival!
How? Well, I designed it to offer flexibility beyond PVP or Survival, but due to its newness, it's best to leave the modpack locked and wait until future updates. 

_Just watch out for mod conflicts since the pack uses the first few optmization mods people would usually select for stuff like this._
